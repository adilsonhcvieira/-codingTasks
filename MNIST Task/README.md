5. Code Walkthrough
5.1 Data Loading and Exploration

Imports necessary libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn.datasets, sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.ensemble, sklearn.metrics).
Loads the MNIST dataset using load_digits from sklearn.datasets.
Prints the shapes of the data and target arrays to understand their dimensions.
Data shape: (1797, 64), representing 1797 images, each with 64 features (8x8 pixels).
Target shape: (1797,), representing 1797 labels (integers from 0-9).
Plots five sample images and their corresponding labels using matplotlib.pyplot.
5.2 Train-Test Split

Splits the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.
80% of the data is used for training, and 20% for testing.
X_train and X_test hold the training and testing image data, respectively.
y_train and y_test hold the training and testing target labels (digit classes).
Setting random_state=42 ensures reproducibility.
5.3 Random Forest Classifier Model

Creates a Random Forest Classifier object using RandomForestClassifier from sklearn.ensemble.
Sets the n_estimators parameter to 100, indicating the number of decision trees in the forest (you can experiment with different values).
Fits the model to the training data using model.fit(X_train, y_train).
5.4 Evaluation Metrics

5.4.1 Confusion Matrix

Predicts labels for the test data using model.predict(X_test).
Calculates the confusion matrix using confusion_matrix from sklearn.metrics.
The confusion matrix shows how many images from each true class were predicted as belonging to each class.
A diagonal dominance indicates good performance.
5.4.2 Classification Report

Generates a detailed classification report using classification_report from sklearn.metrics.
Provides precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.
Precision: How often a predicted label is correct.
Recall: How often the model identifies a class correctly.
F1-score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Support: Total number of true instances for a class.
5.5 Identifying Struggles

Analyzes the confusion matrix and classification report to identify classes where the model struggles.
Calculates the number of misclassified instances for each class.
Reports the classes with the most errors.
