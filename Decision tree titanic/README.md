README: Decision Tree Titanic Survival Prediction
This code explores using a decision tree classifier to predict passenger survival on the Titanic based on features from the Titanic dataset. It also delves into ensemble methods like Random Forests and AdaBoost.

1. Libraries

pandas: Data manipulation
numpy: Numerical operations
sklearn.model_selection: Train-test split
sklearn.tree: Decision tree classifier and visualization
sklearn.metrics: Model evaluation metrics
matplotlib.pyplot: Visualization

2. Data Loading and Preprocessing

Reads the Titanic dataset (assumed to be named "titanic.csv") using pandas.read_csv.
Explores the data by printing the head and checking data types using info().
Drops irrelevant columns like PassengerId, Name, Ticket, and Cabin.
Handles missing values in the Age column by filling with the median age.
One-hot encodes categorical columns (Sex and Embarked) using pd.get_dummies.

3. Feature Engineering

You can consider exploring additional feature engineering techniques here, such as creating new features from existing ones (e.g., family size based on SibSp and Parch).

4. Model Training and Evaluation

Splits the data into training, development (validation), and test sets using train_test_split.
Trains a decision tree classifier without pruning and evaluates its accuracy on the test set.
Analyzes the effect of pruning (limiting tree depth) on accuracy and plots the results.
Trains decision tree models with varying max_depth values, visualizing the decision tree structure for each depth.
Compares training and development accuracies for different max_depth values.
Optionally, exports the final decision tree using Graphviz for a more detailed visual representation (requires Graphviz installation).

5. Ensemble Methods

Trains and evaluates Bagging, Random Forest, and AdaBoost classifiers on the data.
Prints training and development accuracies for each ensemble method.
For the Random Forest model, extracts feature importances to understand which features contribute most to prediction accuracy.
Optionally, you can explore hyperparameter tuning for ensemble methods (e.g., number of estimators, learning rate) to potentially improve performance.

6. Summary

Provides a concise overview of the model accuracies achieved with different techniques:

7. Further Exploration

Consider exploring hyperparameter tuning for the decision tree and ensemble methods.
You can investigate other machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) or neural networks for comparison.
Analyze the confusion matrix and classification report for the best performing model to understand its strengths and weaknesses.
This code provides a solid foundation for using decision trees and ensemble methods for passenger survival prediction on the Titanic dataset. By experimenting with different parameters and techniques, you can potentially improve the model's accuracy and gain deeper insights into passenger survival factors.
